## Why

0-Core is built on the principle that understanding beats convenience.
Manual control forces you to know what you're doing.
Automation hides complexity and creates dependencies.

## What

Every action in 0-Core is deliberate.

- No auto-updates
- No hidden scripts
- No magic automation
- Full transparency

## How (if applicable)

[Technical details, implementation notes]

## Alternatives Considered (if applicable)

[What else we thought about and why we didn't choose it]

## Impact

Users learn the system deeply.
No surprises. No black boxes.
When something breaks, you know why and how to fix it.

## Status Updates
